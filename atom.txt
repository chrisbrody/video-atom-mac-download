ATOM 1.1 - Intro to video for atom
Hey friends! Chris from Codify Academy here.

In this video i'm going to show you how to download the text editor Atom for a MAC.
This is the tool we going to use to write code that creates websites.

ATOM 1.2 - Going to atom.io
Make sure to have a google chrome open, then type atom.io into the search bar, press enter.

This website knows what operating system so you can click download installer.


ATOM 1.3 - Downloading Atom
Now we wait for the atom zip file to download
You might want to pause the video at this point,
it takes a minute.


ATOM 1.4 - Running the program atom
Once downloaded left click the zip start installing.

This also takes a minutes so again pause the video until that's done.

Your downloads folder should open when its finished installing, you need to drag the atom icon into applications.

I already have Atom so it is asking to replace my old one, you should just hear the mac ding of success when you drop it in.


This is what atom looks like when its open.
